# Agent Prompt Structure and Examples

## Agent Prompt Structure

Follow the [dispatch prompt template](../../skill-conventions/references/dispatch-prompt-template.md) for the canonical 6-section structure. The key qualities below complement that template.

Good agent prompts are:
1. **Focused** — One clear problem domain
2. **Self-contained** — All context needed to understand the problem
3. **Specific about output** — What should the agent return?
4. **Bounded** — Specify return format and max token budget

```markdown
Fix the 3 failing tests in src/agents/agent-tool-abort.test.ts:

1. "should abort tool with partial output capture" - expects 'interrupted at' in message
2. "should handle mixed completed and aborted tools" - fast tool aborted instead of completed
3. "should properly track pendingToolCount" - expects 3 results but gets 0

These are timing/race condition issues. Your task:

1. Read the test file and understand what each test verifies
2. Identify root cause - timing issues or actual bugs?
3. Fix by:
   - Replacing arbitrary timeouts with event-based waiting
   - Fixing bugs in abort implementation if found
   - Adjusting test expectations if testing changed behavior

Do NOT just increase timeouts - find the real issue.

Return (under 500 tokens): Summary of root cause, what you fixed, and files changed.
```

## Common Mistakes

**Too broad:** "Fix all the tests" — agent gets lost
**Specific:** "Fix agent-tool-abort.test.ts" — focused scope

**No context:** "Fix the race condition" — agent doesn't know where
**Context:** Paste the error messages and test names

**No constraints:** Agent might refactor everything
**Constraints:** "Do NOT change production code" or "Fix tests only"

**Vague output:** "Fix it" — you don't know what changed
**Specific:** "Return summary of root cause and changes"

## Real Example from Session

**Scenario:** 6 test failures across 3 files after major refactoring

**Failures:**
- agent-tool-abort.test.ts: 3 failures (timing issues)
- batch-completion-behavior.test.ts: 2 failures (tools not executing)
- tool-approval-race-conditions.test.ts: 1 failure (execution count = 0)

**Decision:** Independent domains — abort logic separate from batch completion separate from race conditions

**Dispatch:**
```
Agent 1 -> Fix agent-tool-abort.test.ts
Agent 2 -> Fix batch-completion-behavior.test.ts
Agent 3 -> Fix tool-approval-race-conditions.test.ts
```

**Results:**
- Agent 1: Replaced timeouts with event-based waiting
- Agent 2: Fixed event structure bug (threadId in wrong place)
- Agent 3: Added wait for async tool execution to complete

**Integration:** All fixes independent, no conflicts, full suite green

**Time saved:** 3 problems solved in parallel vs sequentially
